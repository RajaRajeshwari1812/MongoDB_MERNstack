This project is a full-stack flight booking application with a front-end built using HTML5 and CSS3, and a back-end powered by the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The front-end provides a responsive user interface that allows users to search for flights by selecting departure and destination cities, travel dates, and book flights. The back-end manages user requests, handles flight data, and processes bookings. MongoDB is used as the database to store flight and booking details, Express.js serves as the web server, React.js powers the interactive front-end components, and Node.js runs the server-side logic. To set up the project locally, clone the repository, install the necessary dependencies, and run the application using Node.js for the server and React for the front-end, ensuring a seamless and scalable user experience.
